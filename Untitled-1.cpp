#include<iostream>
/*
There are two singly linked lists, LL1 and LL2, having nodes arranged in increasing order of their values. 
Write code to create a single linked list, LL3, with the common nodes in LL1 and LL2. The sequence of nodes 
in LL3 should also be in increasing order of their values. Also, the creation of new nodes is not allowed, 
i.e., LL3 is formed only by repositioning of the existing nodes in LL1 and LL2.

Example:
    LL1: 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 
    LL2: 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8 
    After the execution of the proposed algorithm:
    LL1: 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7 
    LL2: 2 -> 8 
    LL3: 4 -> 6 

Your task is to implement the algorithm or pseudocode to achieve this.
